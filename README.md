# 📊 E-commerce Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes an e-commerce sales dataset to extract meaningful business insights. The goal is to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and forecasting techniques to improve decision-making for inventory management, marketing, and operations.

## 📂 Data Source
- The dataset **Sample - Superstore.csv** contains transaction details, including:
  - **Order Date, Ship Date, Customer Segment, Sales, Profit, Discount, Shipping Mode**
- Stored in a **CSV file** and analyzed using **Jupyter Notebook**.

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- **Handled missing values** – Checking for null values and imputing or removing them if necessary.
- **Converted data types** – Ensuring proper formats, especially for date columns.
- **Removed duplicates** – Eliminating redundant entries.
- **Created calculated columns**  – Such as Processing Time (Ship Date - Order Date) and Sales-to-Profit Ratio.
- **Filtered anomalies and outliers** – Identifying outliers in sales, profit, and discount columns.

ax.set_title("Impact of Discounts on Profit")
plt.show()
```

#### 🖼️ Visualization:
![Discount Effectiveness](images/DiscountEffectiveness.png)

#### 📊 Insights:
- There is a declining trend in profit as the discount increases.
- At 0% discount, profits tend to be higher, with several high-profit transactions.
- As the discount increases beyond 20%, profit margins shrink significantly, with several transactions resulting in losses.
- Higher discount levels (50% and above) show more frequent negative profit values, suggesting diminishing returns or potential losses.

#### 🔍 Key Takeaways:
- Optimal Discounting: Lower discount levels (0-20%) appear to maintain profitability, while higher discounts should be carefully evaluated.
- Profit Erosion: Excessive discounting leads to negative profits, indicating that deep discounts may not be sustainable.
- Strategic Pricing: A data-driven pricing strategy should be implemented to balance competitive pricing and profit sustainability.


### 1️⃣2️⃣ Order Processing Efficiency Analysis
#### 📜 Code:
```python
data['Processing Time'] = (data['Ship Date'] - data['Order Date']).dt.days
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

ax.set_xlabel("Processing Time (days)")
ax.set_ylabel("Frequency")
ax.set_title("Distribution of Order Processing Time")
plt.show()
```

#### 🖼️ Visualization:
![Order Processing Time](images/OrderProcessingEfficiency.png)

#### 📊 Insights:
- The processing time varies between 0 to 7 days, with distinct peaks at 2, 4, and 5 days.
- The highest frequency occurs at 4 days, indicating that most orders are processed within this time frame.
- Some orders are processed instantly (0-1 days), but they are relatively rare.
- A significant number of orders take 6-7 days, which might indicate delays for certain cases.

#### 🔍 Key Takeaways
- Efficiency Benchmark: The majority of orders are processed in 4-5 days, suggesting a standard timeframe for fulfillment.
- Optimization Areas: Reducing processing time beyond 4 days could improve overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.
- Delays Analysis: Orders taking 6-7 days should be analyzed to identify bottlenecks and streamline processes.

### 1️⃣3️⃣ Sales Forecasting Using Exponential Smoothing
#### 📜 Code:
```python
# Ensure 'Sales' is numeric
data['Sales'] = pd.to_numeric(data['Sales'], errors='coerce')

# Resample sales data
data_sales = data.resample('ME', on='Order Date').sum(numeric_only=True)

# Apply Exponential Smoothing
model = ExponentialSmoothing(data_sales['Sales'], trend='add', seasonal='add', seasonal_periods=12).fit()
data_sales['Forecast'] = model.predict(start=data_sales.index[0], end=data_sales.index[-1])
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(data_sales.index, data_sales['Sales'], label="Actual Sales", marker='o')
plt.plot(data_sales.index, data_sales['Forecast'], label="Forecasted Sales", linestyle="dashed")
plt.xlabel("Month")
plt.ylabel("Sales")
plt.title("Sales Forecasting using Exponential Smoothing")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

#### 🖼️ Visualization:
![Sales Forecast](images/SalesForecasting.png)

#### 📊 Insights:
- The sales data shows seasonal patterns with noticeable peaks and troughs throughout the time period.
- The forecasted sales (orange dashed line) follow the actual sales (solid blue line) closely, indicating that the exponential smoothing model captures trends well.
- There are some deviations, particularly during sharp spikes in actual sales, where the forecast lags.
- The upward trend in sales is apparent starting from mid-2016, with higher peaks observed closer to the end of the period.

#### 🔍 Key Takeaways:
- Model Performance: The exponential smoothing model effectively tracks general sales trends, though it struggles with sharp changes in demand.
- Trend Detection: Sales are on an upward trajectory over time, suggesting business growth or seasonal factors driving increased demand.
- Forecast Improvement: Further model tuning or incorporating additional data (such as external factors) could enhance accuracy, particularly around extreme sales spikes.
- Seasonal Insights: Understanding these peaks could help in better resource allocation and inventory planning.

### 1️⃣4️⃣ Delivery Speed Analysis by Ship Mode
#### 📜 Code:
```python
data['Delivery Time'] = (data['Ship Date'] - data['Order Date']).dt.days
ship_mode_avg = data.groupby('Ship Mode')['Delivery Time'].mean().sort_values()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x=ship_mode_avg.index, y=ship_mode_avg.values, hue=ship_mode_avg.index, palette="coolwarm", legend=False)
plt.xlabel("Ship Mode")
plt.ylabel("Average Delivery Time (days)")
plt.title("Average Delivery Time by Ship Mode")
plt.show()
```

#### 🖼️ Visualization:
![Delivery Speed](images/DeliverySpeed.png)

#### 📊 Insights:
- Same Day Delivery: Offers the quickest delivery with an almost negligible average delivery time, making it ideal for urgent orders.
- First Class: Has an average delivery time of approximately 2 days, providing a fast and efficient option for customers seeking expedited service.
- Second Class: Takes around 3 days on average, offering a balance between speed and cost.
- Standard Class: Has the longest average delivery time at about 5 days, likely being the most cost-effective option.

#### 🔍 Key Takeaways:
- Service Efficiency: Same Day and First Class shipping modes are critical for time-sensitive deliveries and likely enhance customer satisfaction.
- Customer Segmentation: Different delivery modes cater to distinct customer priorities—urgency for Same Day and First Class, cost savings for Standard Class.
- Optimization Opportunity: Standard Class delivery time could be analyzed for efficiency improvements without significantly increasing costs.
- Delivery Strategy: Maintaining a mix of delivery options supports diverse customer needs and competitive market positioning.
